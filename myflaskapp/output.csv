00:00,"YUFENG GUO: The world is filled with data, a lot of data--"
00:03,"pictures, music, words, spreadsheets, videos, and it"
00:07,doesn't look like it's going to slow down anytime soon.
00:11,Machine learning brings the promise
00:13,of deriving meaning from all of that data.
00:16,"Arthur C. Clarke famously once said,"
00:18,"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is"
00:20,"indistinguishable from magic."""
00:22,"I found machine learning not to be magic,"
00:25,but rather tools and technology that you
00:28,can utilize to answer questions with your data.
00:31,This is Cloud AI Adventures.
00:33,"My name is Yufeng Guo, and each episode,"
00:36,"we will be exploring the art, science,"
00:38,and tools of machine learning.
00:40,"Along the way, we'll see just how easy"
00:42,it is to create amazing experiences
00:45,and yield valuable insights.
00:47,The value of machine learning is only
00:49,just beginning to show itself.
00:51,There is a lot of data in the world today generated
00:53,"not only by people, but also by computers, phones"
00:57,and other devices.
00:58,This will only continue to grow in the years to come.
01:01,"Traditionally, humans have analyzed data"
01:03,and adapted systems to the changes in data patterns.
01:06,"However, as the volume of data surpasses"
01:09,the ability for humans to make sense of it
01:11,"and manually write those rules, we"
01:14,will turn increasingly to automated systems that
01:16,"can learn from the data and importantly,"
01:19,the changes in data to adapt to a shifting landscape.
01:23,We see machine learning all around us
01:24,in the products we use today.
01:26,"However, it isn't always apparent"
01:28,that machine learning is behind it all.
01:31,While things like tagging objects and people inside
01:35,"of photos are clearly machine learning at play,"
01:38,it may not be immediately apparent
01:39,that recommending the next video to watch
01:41,is also powered by machine learning.
01:44,"Of course, perhaps the biggest example of all"
01:47,is Google search.
01:48,"Every time you use Google search,"
01:50,you're using a system that has many machine learning systems
01:53,"at its core, from understanding the text of your query"
01:56,"to adjusting the results based on your personal interests,"
01:59,such as knowing which results to show you first when searching
02:03,for Java depending on whether you're a coffee expert
02:06,or a developer-- perhaps you're both.
02:08,"Today, machine learning's immediate applications"
02:11,"are already quite wide-ranging, including image recognition,"
02:14,"fraud detection and recommendation systems,"
02:17,as well as text and speech systems too.
02:19,These powerful capabilities can be
02:21,"applied to a wide range of fields,"
02:23,from diabetic retinopathy and skin cancer detection to retail
02:27,"and of course, transportation in the form"
02:29,of self-parking and self-driving vehicles.
02:33,It wasn't that long ago that when a company or product had
02:36,"machine learning in its offerings,"
02:38,it was considered novel.
02:40,"Now, every company is pivoting to use machine learning"
02:43,in their products in some way.
02:45,"It's rapidly becoming, well, an expected feature."
02:48,Just as we expect companies to have a website that
02:51,"works on your mobile device or perhaps an app,"
02:54,the day will soon come when it will
02:56,be expected that our technology will
02:58,"be personalized, insightful and self-correcting."
03:03,"As we use machine learning to make human tasks better, faster"
03:06,"and easier than before, we can also"
03:08,look further into the future when machine learning
03:11,can help us do tasks that we never
03:12,could have achieved on our own.
03:15,"Thankfully, it's not hard to take advantage"
03:17,of machine learning today.
03:18,The tooling has gotten quite good.
03:20,"All you need is data, developers and a willingness"
03:23,to take the plunge.
03:24,"For our purposes, I've shortened the definition"
03:27,of machine learning down to just five words--
03:29,using data to answer questions.
03:32,While I wouldn't use such a short answer
03:34,"for an essay prompt on exam, it serves a useful purpose for us"
03:37,here.
03:38,"In particular, we can split the definition into two parts--"
03:42,using data and answer questions.
03:45,These two pieces broadly outline the two sides
03:47,"in machine learning, both of them equally important."
03:50,"Using data is what we refer to as training,"
03:53,while answering questions is referred to as making
03:56,predictions or inference.
03:59,Now let's drill into those two sides briefly for a little bit.
04:03,Training refers to using our data
04:05,to inform the creation and fine tuning of a predictive model.
04:09,This predictive model can then be
04:11,used to serve up predictions on previously unseen data
04:15,and answer those questions.
04:17,"As more data is gathered, the model"
04:18,can be improved over time and new predictive models deployed.
04:23,"As you may have noticed, the key component"
04:25,of this entire process is data.
04:28,Everything hinges on data.
04:30,"Data is the key to unlocking machine learning, just"
04:33,as much as machine learning is the key to unlocking
04:36,that hidden insight in data.
04:39,This was just a high level overview
04:40,of machine learning-- why it's useful
04:42,and some of its applications.
04:44,"Machine learning is a broad field,"
04:45,spanning an entire family of techniques when
04:47,inferring answers from data.
04:49,"So in future episodes, we'll aim to give you"
04:51,a better sense of what approaches
04:53,to use for a given data set and question
04:56,"you want to answer, as well as provide the tools for how"
04:59,to accomplish it.
05:00,"In our next episode, we'll dive right"
05:02,into the concrete process of doing machine learning
05:05,"in more detail, going through a step-by-step formula for how"
05:09,to approach machine learning problems.
