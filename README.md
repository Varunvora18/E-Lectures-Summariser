# E-Lectures-Summariser

<h2>Abstract</h2>
In these troubled times of pandemic, the teaching-learning process has been affected adversely at
every level of education. Schools and colleges had to shift and adapt to various online platforms for
achieving academic goals set by respective universities and boards and to emulate the past trends of
the academic year and the overall curriculum. The whole process of conducting lectures, practical
sessions and workshops has been changed and this change has its ups and downs.
The students and teachers have been familiarized with computing applications and their functionalities, making them more equipped for the era of computers. Also, for students and teachers who
had to commute to the institution on a daily basis have the advantage of eliminating travelling time
from their daily routine. Some cons of this online process are, lectures can be long, boring and
monotonous. With the absence of a classroom environment, personal touch is lost as a result of
which students have a shorter attention span than usual. Lectures recorded can be viewed later. If
a student misses on a lecture or wishes to revise a concept from the recordings he/she must view
the entire recording of the lecture. Moreover, the student must put in extra time and efforts into
compiling notes. This is not always feasible especially when the student is on a time crunch.
Thus, a system that should aid the students in studying for their exams and utilizing studying time
with efficiency seems to be something that would be welcomed by open arms from students as
well as the teaching community. This aid can be acquired by using AI methodologies to generate
summaries of lectures in the form of concise lecture notes and time-indexed videos according to
subtopics.
